## Description

Every time you check your watch; you see a reminder that we are space pirates on a living rock flying through the universe at 200 km per second.

This is a 24h clock face design that more literally references the origins of how we beings on planets measure time - the rotation of our home planet producing periods of light and dark in direct view and shade of our home star.

> The overview effect is a cognitive shift reported by some astronauts while viewing the Earth from space with... unexpected and even overwhelming emotion, and an increased sense of connection to other people and the Earth as a whole. The effect can cause changes in the observerâ€™s self concept and value system, and can be transformative.
