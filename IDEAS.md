# IDEAS

## Changes

- Try **not** rotating Earth so noon always upwards, date goes around. The Earth rotation is probably the biggest cause of confusion for new viewers telling the time.

## Additions

- Add smooth animations on sunlight (get sun times for next or prev days and lerp).
- Add text info, ideally editable (next/prev; day, full moon, month, year etc).
- Add geolocation settings (drag on earth to change x and y of lat and long).

- Add alternate moon data wrappers.
