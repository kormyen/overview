# IDEAS

## Changes

- Try **not** rotating Earth so noon always upwards, date goes around. The Earth rotation is probably the biggest cause of confusion for new viewers telling the time.

## Additions

- Add smooth animations on sunlight (get sun times for next or prev days and lerp).
- Add text info, ideally editable (next/prev; day, full moon, month, year etc).
- Add geolocation settings (drag on earth to change x and y of lat and long).

## Questions

- Does the tide align to the Moon's apogee and perigee, or does Earth's aphelion and perihelion have a big affect too? Is there a simple visual way to show this connection intuitively?

## New info diplay option

### Likely

- Rainfall amount/weather by hour (around 24h clock).
- Moon types (blood, blue, super etc).
- Show full moon dates as little moon by day of year.
- Show Moon's apogee and perigee (eliptical orbit around Earth)
- Show Earth's aphelion and perihelion (eliptical orbit around Sol)

### Unlikely

- Moon rise time.
- Geolocation? As contenent lines over earth.
- Seasons? (23.4 degree axial tilt of Earth) Displayed via sunrise/sunset markers. (or show around outside of month/date?)
- Solstice? Show around outside of month/date?
- Presession? (25,772~ year cycle) Could be 
- Moon distance? Moon position adjustments and distance lines.
- Lunar eclipses?
- Moon perigee and apogee
