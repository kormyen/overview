## EXPLAINER - OUTDATED

The tellurion is a top down flat abstract cross section view of Earth (central circle) and a view of the moon representing it's current phase.

#### Month of year

The white light on Earth shows the direction of the Sun's light. This is used to tell the day of year and day of month. It starts at the top (12 on a 12 hour clock) and goes clockwise. 

The 12 graduation lines on the outer most ring represent the first day of each month. 

#### Day of Month

The graduation lines for the current month display each day. 

Long graduation lines show 10s, medium lines show 5s. 

The red line is today's date. From this and the above you can figure out the date.

#### Day of Week

Lighter lines show Saturdays and Sundays. From today's red line and the closest weekends you can figure out what the day of week is. 

#### Sunlight hours

The light on Earth shows the sunlight hours, the sunrise and sunset times. The thinnest line is the sunset and sunrise times. The ligher hour is golden hour. 

The first lightest dark layer outside of sunset is 'civil twilight'.
> The Sun is just below the horizon, so there is generally enough natural light to carry out most outdoor activities.

The second layer is nautical twilight.
> Both the horizon and the brighter stars are usually visible at this time, making it possible to navigate at sea.

The third layer is astronomical twilight.
> Most stars and other celestial objects can be seen during this phase.

The dark section is night.

#### Time of day

The triangle is your position on Earth which rotates to show the time mimicing Earth's rotation through a day.

The position of the triangle as it rotates tells you the time of the day in reference to the direction of the sun light. Directly pointing toward the sun would be noon.

#### Moon phase

The changing shape orbiting Earth is the moon. The position of it as it orbits Earth (and it's corresponding shape) tells you the current moon phase. The white light on the moon fills as it approaches the opposite side of the sun - as from Earth we see this as a "full moon".
